  <p> What is here is elsewhere, what is not here is nowhere. There is nowhere to get to, it is all here now. These famous quotes are from the Mahabharata which is the great epic of India, comprised of 100,000 verses.
    <br />
  Some quotations include “Any brahman knowing the four Vedas, including the sciences based upon them and the Upanishads, but does not know ‘this tale’ (the Mahabharata) would not be considered a truly wise man; the Mahabharata is for all practical purposes considered the fifth Veda.
    <br />
  No story is found on earth which does not depend on this tale… What is here is elsewhere, what is not here is nowhere.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The work recounts the events before, during and after the great battle for kingship waged at Kuruksetta between the Pandavas and Kauravas branches of the Kuru lineage of descendants of Bharata (whence is derived the Sanskrit meaning of the
    Mahabharata, “the great [tale of] Bharata’s descendants”). Also the epic contains didactic material of encyclopedic proportion (particularly in books 12 and 13, the Santi- and Anusasana- puranas), along with elaborate genealogies and much myth
    and legend (especially in books 1 and 3).
    <br />
The sage, or seer, Vyasa (Krishna Dvanpayana), is thought to have composed the epic and taught it to his student Vaisampayana who in turn performed the first recitation of the work at a snake sacrifice” conducted by King Janamejaya; the purpose was to inform the king of the deeds of his ancestors. Then the epic was carried by the bard Ugrasravas to the forest sacrifice of the brahman Saunaka.<br />
    <br />
Actually, the Mahabharata in its present form was composed over a long period of time, c. 400 BC to 400 AD. Over this time period various groups influence its development, which is still reflected. They were warriors and their bards, brahmans, and devotees. The action of the Mahabharata simultaneously proceeds on several levels. First is the typically Indo-European heroic tale of the battle of good against evil, modeled after the specifically Indo-Aryan version of the theme, the devas (gods, here incarnate in the Pandavas) against the asuras (demons, reflected in the Kauravas, who incarnate raksasses). From this point of view, the Kuruksetta war is visualized as a gigantic sacrifice conducted by semi-divine epic heroes. Mixed with this semi-mythical material is consideration of the human-centered issue of the decline of dharma at the onset of Kali-yuga, the present degenerate age of history, which the Mahabharata conceives as having begun at the time of the Kuruksetta war. Dharma suffered a huge setback at the Pandava-Kaurava dice game played early in the epic. From then on, the lines of right and wrong were drawn less clearly than the Indo-European substructure of the epic might cause one to expect, for example the “good” Pandavas defeat the “evil” Kauravas, but only by trickery and deceit. One high point of human uncertainty in the work is the episode of the Bhagavad-Grita, in which the Pandava hero Arjuna casts down his weapon before the war begins, dismayed at the prospect of having to fight against his relatives and elders on the other side. In the Bhagavad-Grita and throughout the Mahabharata, it is a “Hindu” element, revolving particularly around the character of the god Vishnu, incarnate as Krishna, and his alliance with the Pandavas, which resolves the tension. “Where Krishna is there is dharma…there is victory.” Orchestrated by Krishna, the Kuruksetta war is a cosmic event. Through its emphasis on Krishna, theMahabharata becomes the locus of a bhakti (devotional) synthesis, which characterizes Hinduism from this time onward

  <h2>Bhagvad Gita</h2>
  <p>
    Bhagvad Gita is a part Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata. Bhagavad means “of God” and Gita means “song.” Hence, the Bhagavad Gita literally means “Song of God.” It is a dialogue that took place between the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna and His devotee
    Arjun, on the verge of the Mahabharat war.<br />
    <br/>
    The Bhagavad Gita was originally compiled by Ved Vyas as a separate text. Later, when he wrote the Mahabharat, he embedded the Bhagavad Gita in it. The Mahabharat contains one hundred thousand verses, and is therefore, the largest poem in the world. It is seven times bigger than the Iliad and Odyssey put together and three times bigger than the Bible. Along with the Ramayan, it is accorded the status of Itihās, meaning historical manuscript of India. Its stories and moral instructions have fashioned the fabric of Indian culture for thousands of years. The Mahabharat is divided into eighteen sections. The Bhagavad Gita is set in the sixth section, which is called the Bheeshma Parva. It comprises eighteen chapters of the section, beginning from Chapter Twenty-five, and continuing until the Chapter Forty-two.

Since the Bhagavad Gita encapsulates most of the important aspects of the knowledge of the Vedas, it is also called Gitopanishad, or the Gitā Upaniṣhad<br />
    <br />
Knowledge that helps a person resolve immediate problems is one kind of enlightenment, while knowledge that dispels the root of ignorance to solve all problems in one strike is another kind of enlightenment. The Bhagavad Gita aims at the second kind of enlightenment by destroying the darkness of ignorance that has enveloped the soul since endless lifetimes. Unable to deal with the immediate problem at hand, Arjun approached Shree Krishna for a palliative to overcome the anguish he was experiencing. Shree Krishna did not just advise him on his immediate problem, but digressed to give a profound discourse on the philosophy of life.<br />
    <br />
There is one kind of teaching that propagates a dogma, cult or creed. There is another kind of teaching that propagates ideals and life principles that are supremely above all cults and creeds. Scholars who regard the Gita as the fruit of some particular religious system do injustice to the universality of its message. The ideas it presents are not the speculations of a philosophic intellect, rather they are the enduring truths of spiritual realities that are verifiable in our own existence and sojourn through life. Thus, when the first English edition of the Gita was published, Warren Hastings, the then Governor General of India, wrote in his foreword: “These (writings of the inhabitants of India) will survive when the British dominion of India shall have long ceased to exist, and when the sources which it yielded of wealth and power are lost to remembrance.”<br />
    <br />
The Gita is not a treatise of metaphysical philosophy, despite the profusion of metaphysical ideas that arise from its pages. Instead, it seeks the highest truth for the highest practical utility, not for intellectual or even spiritual satisfaction, but as the truth that saves and opens to us the passage from our present mortal imperfection to an immortal perfection. We must therefore approach it for help and light in receiving the living message that can benefit human beings attain the highest welfare and spiritual perfection.<br />
    <br />
 The perennial wisdom of the Gita has continued to inspire famous thinkers even in modern times, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Robert Oppenheimer, Carl Jung, Herman Hesse, and Aldous Huxley, to name just a few, thus indicating its divine origin.
